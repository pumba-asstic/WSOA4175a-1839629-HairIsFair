            <h3>Core Design principles and Aesthetics of the Web</h3>
          <p>
          Park (2007) Gives 4 aspects of design principles, he closes looks at the relationship between the net artist,
           the users(audience) and the artwork. He goes on to give what these design principles entail. 
           By starting with the <b><u>INVISIBLE/ HIDDEN ELEMENTS</u></b>, stating that this is the programming language,
          the language that is used to display the things on the screen, used to create the artwork, 
          stating that this is the form that forms the artwork, 
          the forms are the tools and design elements. 
          </p>

          <p>
          They are reused and recreated as the art form through visual and functional features of the design approach. 
          These forms are referred to the brushes that a traditional artist would use to paint on a canvas, 
          here the canvas and the brush are the internet. 
          They are unchangeable programmed components.  
          </p>

          <p>
          The second principle is the <b><u>COLLABORATIVE PARTICIPATION</u></b>, he is showing the relationship between the artist and the user/ audience,
          referring to net art as a process that has no beginning nor an end. Here the user becomes part of the creation of the art work,
          the interactivity falls in how the net art creates a community and communication means, 
          where the artist and the audience can continuously communicate with each other , there are no physical boundaries that are tied to it,
          but here I pose a question of what is the goal of the art work ? doesn’t the 
          communication points and interactivity fall under what the goal of the artist is with the artwork?  
          </p>

          <p>
          Park goes on to explain that the net art only exists and is form through user participation.
          Quoting what Adrian says that net art is not aimed at the minority, which is the creator, 
          but it is aimed at the users who are the majority. Yes, we understand that net art is formed and can only exist through the
           active participation of the user and is made possible through user-centred design. 
           But can the artist decide to create artwork that does not rely on the active participation of the audience? 
           What if the goal is to have by standers that are in the desire to own the artwork through NFTs and just like
          how traditional artwork works, the audience is not part of the creation, but they get to see and have the desire to own the piece? 
           can it be done where the user is just a bystander and does not fall under the “community” bases?? 
          </p>

          <p>
          The third principle leads from the above question, <b><u>ANARCHIC STRUCTURE</u></b>. 
          Here it is referred as the where the artist and the audience have equal standing, 
          they both become the subject in the net art, there are no clear definitions from the artist and the user,
          they both carry the same role. 
          This principle breaks the traditional art system triangle. 
          </p>
          <img className='Img2' src={AnarchicImage}/>

          <p>
          The triangle is a representation of the anarchic system and communicational system that the audience,
          creator, and artwork/ content have. Park talks about the structure of communication being to share
           experiences online without any restrictions and a non-hierarchical structure and language. 
          </p>

          <p>
          The fourth and final principle that Park names is the <b><u>NON-LINEAR COMMUNICATION</u></b> this principle is almost one and same as the third one, 
          this implies that the process and goal of net art is that it has no beginning nor an end, it is a forever changing thing. 
          There is also an element of no desire for the artwork that is forever changing. Making this difficult for the NFT question. 
          yes, the net art is made with no desire of it being owned by the audience, but what about NFT’s. 
          </p>

          <p>
          Now I’m gladly going to talk about the role of aesthetics in web design that Thorlacuis (2007). 
          There are four main roles that aesthetics play in web design. 
          In this section I’m going to talk about how I implement these roles within my website. 
          Hair is Fair the main roles are as listed:
          </p>
          <ol className="ReferenceList">
            	<li>Supporting content and functionality.</li> 
              <li>Appeal to the target audience taste.</li> 
              <li>Creating a desired image for the sender.</li> 
              <li>Addressing the requirements of the website genre.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
          Applying the above roles into my site. will be as followed, the functionality of the site will be in coherent with the content 
          and the subject of the site. the name of the game is <i>Hair is Fair</i>. Thorlacious refers to functionality as the UX and UI the 
          experience for the user to have a fast and efficient site without any downloading and uploading time, 
          a hyper functionality site. 
          </p>
          <p>I relay this the same way that we think of human hair, the speed that human hair grows, 
          is how I am looking at the functionality of my site. this is also in relation to the applying the
           5 User friendly components that are mentioned by Thorlacious. <i>Learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, satisfaction.</i> 
            Thorlacious refer to aesthetics as the elements of visual communication, she gives 4 reasons of how aesthetics support sender image,
           content and function of the site, the target audience and genre. 
          <ol className="ReferenceList">
            <li>Aesthetics must be designed with the sender image in min, with the perceived image and 
            the source of information that “convey the organization behind the information”,
             here the effects must be in line with the source and 
            the image of where the information comes from. 
            </li>
            <li>
            Aesthetics effects must support the content and functional aspects, 
            this is the user-friendly part it also includes how the site and content as well as the interactive aspects of the
            site communicate with the aesthetics,
             the visual elements
            </li>
            <li>The effects must be adapted to the genre of the site, there are different expectations for different site genres,
             i.e Hair is fair is a site for hair, it investigates the stigmas of hair in different races and the different textures
             that hair comes in as well as the stereotypes that comes with different hair. It’s a site that gives information do the 
            visual information as well as the functionality of the site must be according to the genre. 
            </li>
            <li>It must be adapted to the target audience; the effects must be visually appealing to its targeted audience. 
              The audience for hair is fair is all people with hair, but mostly targeted at females in corporate spaces in how they navigate 
              the “office hairstyle” The effects should be designed according to the audience,
               everything about hair is fair will be dealing with hair.
            </li>
          </ol>
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Aesthetics in web design, play a big role. It is not only how the visual elements look on the site, 
          but also how they communicate with each other in giving the user a pleasant experience that is effective and efficient. 
          It is about the feel they give to the user and how the information is being communicate to the user of the site. 
          <b>ALWAYS DESIGN WITH THE USER IN MIND.</b>
